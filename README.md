# Gravity-Engine

## TODO

### Mechanics

- Use gamepad right stick to change gravity
- Make jump faster (more powerful + increase gravity- keep 2 tiles)
- Prevent changing gravity when not grounded
- Animate light on backpack
- Physics crates (affected by gravity change)
- Buttons connected to doors (color coded)
	- Activate something only while pressed (walk or fall on)
	- Levers- Toggle something when switched (walk or fall over)
- Background effects- particles fall in gravity direction (with trail)
- Color tilemap (GameManager? or will that be persistent)
- Spikes?
- Conveyor belts? move things on top of them
